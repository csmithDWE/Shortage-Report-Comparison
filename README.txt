Application: Shortage Report Copy Comments
Release v1.0.0

The shortage report copy comments application is designed to analyze and compare two shortage reports 
generated by Quickbooks. 

Description:
Program prompts user to select two files, then compares all values in columns C:E of both spreadsheets (recursively).
Any cells within those columns that appear on both spreadsheets (regardless of row #, column must match) then have
a check performed to see if the source spreadsheet has a comment in column 'T', then copies that comment over directly. 
No formatting for text effects of colors is copied, simply the text value. Does not work with references. 

Dependencies: 
The application currently only works with .xlsx files
The application relies on the title of the sheets to be compared to be "Sheet1"
Comments to be copied must be in Column 'T' of the source spreadsheet
Comparisons are only performed on a row-by row basis of columns C,D,E. Anything outside is not analyzed. Comparison of rows
is non-position dependent (i.e., a value of C15 on source file matching C20 on destination is possible, witht the comment
carried to the appropriate row of the destination file). 

The .exe file and its related dependcies can be generated using the auto-py-to-exe library if needed.
